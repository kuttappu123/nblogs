     Here are three ways social engineering attack tactics are rapidly changing and some things to look out for as the practice continually evolves:<br>
      <h6><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Social engineers are using social media.</h6>
     <p>Before the rise of social media, social engineers had to jump through more hoops to locate free open-source intelligence (OSINT) to create clever narratives to deceive their victims. 
     From scouring phone books and instructional catalogs to calling into businesses to get names of those within the company structure (AKA, voice phishing or vhishing),
	 social engineers had to do a lot of preliminary research before actually launching their attack
	 Today, public information about individuals and businesses alike is accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
	 From social media platforms to online public records and digital phone books,
	 information is much more readily available than it once was.
     Whether it be the email that is connected to user profiles which can provide access to more intimate data or the simple act of 
	 “checking in” to various locations via social platforms that conveys when individuals are not home to commence home burglaries, 
	 the popularity of social media has shifted not only the abundance of freely sharing information but the accessibility of that information to social engineers.
	 Bad actors also use networking platforms like LinkedIn to discover the hierarchy within a company’s hiring structure to target recently hired employees— impersonating managerial staff to get employees to grant them access to the corporate network
     </p>
	 <h6><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Social engineers are leveraging artificial intelligence to develop “deepfakes.”</h6>
     <p>Even ten years ago, it was hard to impersonate someone’s voice and appearance online. Today, 
	 sophisticated technology makes it not only possible but in some cases, fairly convincing. 
	 That's why the FBI has issued an advisory warning about a foreboding increase in “deepfakes.”
     Our partners at KnowBe4 explain it quite well, “Deepfakes are images, videos, audio, or text created via (artificial intelligence) AI to produce extremely convincing imitations of real people.
	 ” They're named for the deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms used to make them. All a bad actor needs to do is insert a few video and audio clips of the real person into software, 
	 artificial intelligence can screen and detect commonalities in movement and speech to replicate the example.
     AI technology makes it possible to produce videos that look like a real person, opening a world of possibilities for cybercriminals to manipulate you online and across any device. 
	 From sending a voice memo that sounds like your boss asking you to transfer funds to a video recording of an IT personnel asking you to reset your password, 
	 the possibilities for future digital manipulation are becoming more and more sophisticated. 
     According to the FBI, as of March 2021, “Malicious actors almost certainly will leverage synthetic content for cyber and foreign influence operations in the next 12-18 months.”
     New-age social engineering schemes are costing major organizations thousands of dollars in damage and raising concerns over the effectiveness of modern-day multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods. 
	 Suddenly, voice or face recognition technology is at risk of compromise— and other forms of verification are necessary</p>
	 <h6><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Social engineers are targeting web applications.</h6>
	 <p>
     In addition to using social media to find open-source information to use in cyberattacks, social engineers are also targeting your social accounts to gain access to other platforms. 
	 With more and more people allowing sign-ups and sign-ins through their Facebook login, for instance, users are giving bad actors one thing to hack to gain access to multiple web applications.
     Inherently, web applications are more vulnerable than we think— with many developers not conducting thorough penetration tests often or at all. 
	 Cybercriminals may crack your password on an application and use it to get into all your accounts if you’re reusing or sharing access to login credentials.
	 Pair this threat with the latest data breach scam, SIM swapping, and even your phone number isn’t a safe form of verification anymore.</p>
